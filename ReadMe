1. First clone wasmtime repository (https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)
2. Build the wasmtime repository with cargo build

For C Wrapper:
    1. Then run the cmake file in wasmtime_cpp_lib to build the shared library that will be used for java 
    2. Run WasmTimeWrapper java file to run the multiply example.

For Rust Wrapper.
    1. Go to wasmtime_rust_lib directory
    2. Build the shared library with "cargo build --release" command.
    3. Copy the generated target/release/libwasmtime_wrapper_lib.dylib to the directory of Java file.

For Rust Performance Test.
    1. Go to wasmtime_rust_perf directory
    2. Build the executable with "cargo build --release" command.
    3. Copy wasm/multiply.wasm to wasmtime_rust_perf directory
    4. Run the following command to start perf test
        ./target/release/perf_test

    Example output:
    Elapsed Time: Wasm 3.03s, Native: 93.27ms
